# Avalonia-Realistic-Text-To-Speech-TTS-
This is a small project. it uses [Coqui.ai](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) and [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) to speech any given text.
All you need is to run the [Coqui Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRaDe08cUIk) on your destkop while your application is running. To compile the project you also need to include the NAudio NuGet package.

Leave me a star if you will.
